Website Project Report – Erahh Clothing


1. Introduction to the Website Theme
The project focuses on building a professional e-commerce website for Erahh Clothing, a premium fashion brand catering to modern professionals.
The website allows users to:
•	Browse products and categories.
•	View detailed product pages with multiple images, colors, and sizes.
•	Add products to a cart and proceed to checkout.
•	Submit and read customer reviews.
•	Contact the brand via a professional contact form.
The primary objective was to create a visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive website that accurately reflects the brand’s premium and professional identity.

2. Design Concept and Color Scheme Rationale
The design concept revolves around minimalist professionalism: clean layouts, intuitive navigation, and emphasis on products.
Color Scheme:
•	Navy Blue (#0b1931): Primary color for headers, buttons, and CTAs, representing trust and professionalism.
•	Soft Beige (#f1e7db): Accent color for highlights and secondary elements, adding warmth and elegance.
•	White (#ffffff): Background for product cards and main content to ensure clarity.
•	Muted Gray (#6b7a86): Text for secondary information and subtle UI elements.
The combination of navy and beige conveys a luxury yet approachable feel, while the layout emphasizes readability and product visibility.
